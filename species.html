            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">What are Kulpera?</h1>
            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>Kulpera are a vulpic-ungulate species native to the Realm of Elune! Originating from the two gods, Luna and Sol, who once called deep space home, this highly diverse species has evolved into what we see roaming all parts of Elune today.</p>

<p>Kulpera come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and talents! These talents were formed around the areas they reside in and have caused their bodies to evolve to better suit the environments they call home, resulting in a wide array of diverse traits. All kulpera share some basic anatomy, though! Sporting hooves on their back legs, and large fangs that poke out from their elongated muzzles, Kulpera appear much more menacing than they actually are. Preferring peaceful solutions over anything else, you'll rarely find these calm creatures in conflict with one another, or with the other creatures that share the realm with them. Thats not to say they can't defend themselves, though. All in all, Kulpera are a kind and generous species who are glad to share the realm with anyone and everyone in it.

            <div class="pl-4">
                
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Garden Dwellers</h2>    
            	<p>Garden Dwellers are timid, friendly Kulpera residing mostly in eastern Rlune. Bonded with nature, these Kulpera are often seen with flower manes, insect body parts, plant growth, and much more.</p>
<p>With extensive knowledge of the Realm's flora, they are Elune's farmers, craftsmen, gardeners and herbal healers. They get along well with everyone, working alongside Animal Whisperers and Aqua Searchers more than any other Kulpera Talent. They are slightly timid around Volcano Explorers, due to worries over accidental plant fires.
Garden Dwellers also have close relationships with Fenera, built mainly on the trading of herbs, garden equipment, food and other supplies. And with Faelings, who help them cultivate and harvest crops.</p>

            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Crystal Keepers</h2>
				<p>Having evolved dense, compact and crystalline bones to suit their crystal growths, geodes and precious metals.
They are Elune's miners and rarely seen above the surface. Those who do leave the mines are often blacksmiths and jewlers. Providing the Realm with precious gemstones found underground.
Stoic and quiet, they get along well with every talent, although they typically prefer to reside among other Crystal Keepers.</p>
<p>Beware though, as these crystallized Kulpera will do anything to protect the intergrity of the caves and their work; it's impossible to fool one with fake gems or worm your way into Elune's caverns.</p>

            <hr class="my-5">

			<h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Animal Whisperers</h2>
				<p>Animal Whisperers are currently on a conquest to find & document all of the creatures in Elune.
Their return will reveal many different types of creatures as well as their new trait sheets.
During this time they can not be made with myo’s.</p>

            <hr class="my-5">
                    
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Volcano Explorers</h2>
				<p>Flamboyant and fiery bodies with personalities to match, these kulperas are Elune’s resident fireballs. Their long legged forms often sport flames, hardened magma, and other volcanic features.
Volcano Explorers thrive in some of Elune’s most hostile lands, taking up trades like blacksmithing, cooking, and other forms of metalwork, exporting their fire-forged work across the realm. They are also talented geologists with a deep understanding of Elune’s volcanic regions.</p>
<p>Despite their reputation for being dangerous, which has caused some tension among other talents, these daring kulperas work hard to debunk that stereotype, promoting the talent as a welcoming, daring, and optimistic group.</p>

            <hr class="my-5">

            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Aqua Searchers</h2>
            <p>Slender-bodied and aquatic kulperas, the Aqua Searchers call the various oceans, lakes, and rivers around Elune home. They occupy any body of water, having grown to fit the watery environment.
Gills, webbed paws, fishlike features, and even watery body parts are common in this intuitive, quick-witted talent. As ambassadors of the seas, Aqua Searchers are Elune’s fishermen, oceanographers, meteorologists, and protectors of the waterlife in all areas of the realm.</p>
<p>They maintain the balance of giving and taking from the water, and protect their homes fiercely. They have a close symbiotic relationship with the Garden Dwellers, working to help irrigate their farmlands. While it’s not a negative relationship, the Aqua Searcher community is wary of the Volcano Explorers.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Hyperboreans</h2>
            <p>Broad, thick-furred Kulpera, these wintery beasts reside in Elune’s coldest areas. They are the most resilient and resourceful of all talents and often have bodies featuring wide paws, dense fur, and icy limbs.
As experienced mountaineers, the Hyperboreans often take up occupations involving exploration, cargo transport, and crafting.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Hyperboreans studied paleontology, history, and ancient biology, having explored and excavated ruins and remains from the permafrosts of their frosty territory.</p>
<p>With their homelands being so harsh, these kulperas don’t often interact with others and are rarely seen outside of the lands they inhabit. In particular, they prefer to avoid the Volcano Explorers out of fear of mutual injury (fire and ice, traditionally not a friendly combination). However, as major exporters of supplies and fur-lined clothing, they maintain a friendly relationship with the majority of Elune.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Dragon Tamers</h2>
            <p>Dragon tamers mostly reside in the Drakon Jungles, however different subspecies have evolved to inhabit many other areas of Elune. Transcended dragon tamers also often leave the jungle on their own special quests and missions.</p>
<p>While subspecies of dragon tamers cannot transcend, they have certain weather specific specialties. Kulians are fantastic at predicting earthquakes, wiragons have keen senses to monitor cloud and air quality and wind direction, rapterians able to sense changes in plant and soil health, and aquarians with their ability to detect minute changes in water temperature and sense storms approaching.</p>
<p>For the dragon tamers that can ascend, they must first learn all there is to learn about being a dragon tamer. This includes learning from all the different subspecies and understanding their ways of weather prediction, environment control, and overall protection of the health of the ecosystem of Elune, while also taking on the task of taming smaller and younger dragons that live in the jungles where dragon tamers call home. These pesky young dragons like to cause minor weather related chaos while growing up themselves, so it’s important for dragon tamers to learn quickly and help keep them in check!</p>
<p>Once transcended, it’s now a dragon tamers duty to take one of the largest jobs in Elune. Calming the weather dragons. These massive dragons are just folklore and myths to the rest of Elune, however transcended dragon tamers know that it’s up to them to use all they’ve learned to calm them down when angered or upset. These weather dragons are the true source of all weather in Elune, and if natural disasters strike, it’s certainly because one of these massive beasts are aggravated.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Alchemists</h2>
            <p>Alchemists are the scientists of Elune. They study and experiment with a wide array of magic and dedicate their lives to it, so are rarely seen. The few that decide to stray from the path of magical experimentation tend to be precision surgeons or high level doctors.</p>
<p>Alchemic magic is broken down into two main studies: Light and Dark. Light magic alchemists are what most Elunians see as a traditional alchemist, but dark magic alchemists play with something so dangerous that it begins to alter their bodies. If they take it too far.. there are dire consequences.</p>
<p>These corruptions are extremely rare, and require an item from the shop to apply to your Kulpera, MYO or not. They also can only be applied to fully dark alchemists with no light alchemist traits.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Kulptober</h2>
            <p>A spooky and elusive talent that only appears once a year. While they may look menacing, looks can be deceiving. Some Kulptober Kulpera end up falling in love with the peaceful and kind ways of Elune and stick around all year.</p>
<p>A rift in space and time during the tenth lunar cycle allows for severely mutated, Kulpera-like beings to emerge. No on in Elune is certain if they truly are Kulpera, but they bear Fae Stones in the shape of skulls, and seem to have magical abilities, so it is assumed that they are just an elusive Kulpera Talent. It has also been noted that their unique traits are recreatable during this lunar cycle by the Alchemists, so perhaps that is how they came to be in the first place.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">            

            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Forest Protectors</h2>
            <p>Possibly Elune’s most mysterious talent, the Forest Protectors are unlike any other Kulpera. With large masks replacing a muzzle, their appearance sets them apart from the other talents.</p>
<p>The masks help channel spiritual energy, with the lack of face helping to remove them from the “real world”. They sport large, mutated hooves, antlers, and fluffy manes. They possess the ability to stand on two legs without the need of a potion.</p>
<p>Reclusive and powerful, the Forest Protectors keep careful watch over the forests and the spirits within them, ready to protect their territory at all times. They have a symbiotic relationship with the forest spirits, who light the way for these Kulpera to traverse the forests. </p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Star Seekers</h2>
            <p>Star Seekers are Elune’s oldest, most ethereal talent. Legends say they’re the offspring of gods.
Their long, elegant bodies shimmer with starlight, and constellations decorate their body.</p>
<p>They are proud individuals and the highest among Elunian societies; often astronomers, teachers, and historians.
The majority of the Star Seekers reside in Aestraus Kingdom, unwilling to get paws or hooves dirty with mere land work.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-5">
            
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Exileds</h2>
            <p>Stripped from their talents for crimes against Elune, these Kulpera are left to wander the Badlands, their magic slowly fading from them. Magic drains out via bioluminescent fissures located where talent traits used to be. Any talent-specific features are left to decay as time passes.</p>
<p>Phase one is the immediate result of the Fae Stone, trait, and talent removal. This process can only be done by a select group of Alchemists who reside near the Badlands, protecting The Exileds and Elune from each other. To ensure this protection, this group, called The Order, maintain a constant forcefield around this barren area.</p>
<p>Phase two emerges after a slow deterioration of the body. With nothing to eat, death seems imminent for these Kulpera. Often nicknamed "the bargaining phase", a Kulpera can choose to make ammends and hope for help to stop the further withering of ther bodies. Little is known about the redemption process, but after this stage, this opportunity vanishes.</p>
<p>Phase three is the final stage of Exiled decay. Their skull is fully exposed, their bones begin to show, fur falls out in clumps, and their skin thins and tears. In order to stop their bodies from completely deteriorating around them, a Kulpera must attack and drain a living Elunian of their magic. Any original magic an Exiled had retained morphs into a void-like substance. Their pain vanishes upon the dispatching of their victim, but so does their morality. They are mindless, soulless, and exist only to drain the life and magic of others. However, they are not perfectly immortal, and will continue to decompose until their bodies support them no longer. The only way to stop this process is the continuous searching, luring, and draining of victims.</p>
