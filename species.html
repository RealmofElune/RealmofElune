            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>Kulpera are a vulpic-ungulate species native to the Realm of Elune! Originating from the two gods, Luna and Sol, who once called deep space home, this highly diverse species has evolved into what we see roaming all parts of Elune today.</p>

<p>Kulpera come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and talents! These talents were formed around the areas they reside in and have caused their bodies to evolve to better suit the environments they call home, resulting in a wide array of diverse traits. All kulpera share some basic anatomy, though! Sporting hooves on their back legs, and large fangs that poke out from their elongated muzzles, Kulpera appear much more menacing than they actually are. Preferring peaceful solutions over anything else, you'll rarely find these calm creatures in conflict with one another, or with the other creatures that share the realm with them. Thats not to say they can't defend themselves, though. All in all, Kulpera are a kind and generous species who are glad to share the realm with anyone and everyone in it.

            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">The Talents</h1>
            <div class="pl-4">
                
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Garden Dwellers</h2>    
            	<p>Garden Dwellers are timid, friendly Kulpera residing mostly in eastern Rlune. Bonded with nature, these Kulpera are often seen with flower manes, insect body parts, plant growth, and much more.
With extensive knowledge of the Realm's flora, they are Elune's farmers, craftsmen, gardeners and herbal healers. They get along well with everyone, working alongside Animal Whisperers and Aqua Searchers more than any other Kulpera Talent. They are slightly timid around Volcano Explorers, due to worries over accidental plant fires.
Garden Dwellers also have close relationships with Fenera, built mainly on the trading of herbs, garden equipment, food and other supplies. And with Faelings, who help them cultivate and harvest crops.</p>
			
            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Crystal Keepers</h2>
				<p>Having evolved dense, compact and crystalline bones to suit their crystal growths, geodes and precious metals.
They are Elune's miners and rarely seen above the surface. Those who do leave the mines are often blacksmiths and jewlers. Providing the Realm with precious gemstones found underground.
Stoic and quiet, they get along well with every talent, although they typically prefer to reside among other Crystal Keepers.
Beware though, as these crystallized Kulpera will do anything to protect the intergrity of the caves and their work; it's impossible to fool one with fake gems or worm your way into Elune's caverns.</p>

			<h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Animal Whisperers</h2>
				<p>Animal Whisperers are currently on a conquest to find & document all of the creatures in Elune.
Their return will reveal many different types of creatures as well as their new trait sheets.
During this time they can not be made with myo’s.</p>

			<h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Volcano Explorers</h2>
				<p>Flamboyant and fiery bodies with personalities to match, these kulperas are Elune’s resident fireballs. Their long legged forms often sport flames, hardened magma, and other volcanic features.
Volcano Explorers thrive in some of Elune’s most hostile lands, taking up trades like blacksmithing, cooking, and other forms of metalwork, exporting their fire-forged work across the realm. They are also talented geologists with a deep understanding of Elune’s volcanic regions.
Despite their reputation for being dangerous, which has caused some tension among other talents, these daring kulperas work hard to debunk that stereotype, promoting the talent as a welcoming, daring, and optimistic group.</p>
