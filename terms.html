Normal Members may not create a Kulpera without an appropriate MYO (Make Your Own) Ticket, as this species is semi-closed.

All types of MYO Tickets are obtainable for free with species currency, making the species semi-closed.</li>

      <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">4.0 Character Designs</h4>
      <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
        <li>In order to create a Kulpera, you need the appropriate MYO Ticket, or explicit permission from Aurora (Mothsteria).</li>
        <li>Other RoE species have different criteria in order to create them and are subject to change.</li>
        <li>You are given one (1) Uncommon MYO upon joining The Realm of Elune Discord server for the first time to create your first Kulpera. You may also purchase MYO Tickets with Species Currency, obtain them through level up within the Discord server, earn them through contests, giveaways and events, etc.</li>
        <li>Unofficial design concepts may not be sold as adopts or advertised as Kulpera, even if it is disclosed that they are not official.</li>
        <li>If you are not a member of staff, you may not advertise custom RoE customs or commissions. This means you may not advertise that you will design someone’s MYO for them. Others may advertise that they are looking for someone to design their MYO for them, as long as they have the required items.</li>
        <li>RoE characters may be created from pre-existing designs, as long as you have explicit permission from the original designer. You may not create RoE characters from copyrighted characters, including, but not limited to, cartoons, comics, games, movies, etc. This is in violation of our rule against plagiarism (section 2.2.3), and would be considered theft. Inspiration is allowed with proper credit, but design approval will ultimately be up to staff discretion.</li>
        <li>All RoE designs must remain SFW. Any designs deemed NSFW will not be approved or affiliated with RoE.</li>
        <li>Any RoE character re-designs require specific items that can be purchased with species currency. All re-designs must still follow the original artists ToS, along with the RoE ToS, and be submitted through the appropriate channels within the Discord server. Re-designs that render a RoE character unrecognizable are not allowed.</li>
        <li>RoE designs will never be revoked from members except for certain circumstances. This includes breaking certain ToS that would result in a void from the species, for more information on voiding, see section 5.1, or if a payment to a staff member falls through.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr class="my-5">

      <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">4.1 Character Sales and Trades</h4>
      <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
        <li>Official RoE character sales are held within The Realm of Elune Discord or on the KulperaSpecies Instagram account only. If you suspect a scam, please contact a RoE staff member immediately.</li>
        <li>Purchasing a RoE character or design is done at the discretion and risk of the buyer. We are not responsible for the reimbursement in the case of user based scams or breaking of the ToS by a third party. Please check that any RoE character you purchase from another member has a link back to our Masterlist toyhou.se account. This link is required for any transactions between members.</li>
        <li>Trading a character for anything other than real world currency is up to buyer and seller discretion. Please use your best judgment when completing trades with other members. </li>
        <li>You may not delete any art after someone has agreed to purchase a RoE character from you, if they expect to receive all works shown in their toyhou.se profile. This may result in a warning or ban, depending on severity.</li>
        <li>Backing out of sales or trades is highly frowned upon within the RoE community, and while we cannot control what happens between member sales or trades, backing out of sales or trades between staff and members may result in warnings or bans, depending on number of offenses and severity. This goes both ways for staff and members.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr class="my-5">

      <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">4.2 Character Value</h4>
      <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
        <li>The base value of RoE characters is documented upon Masterlist creation. Please ensure you are not overpaying for a character when purchasing a RoE character from another member. </li>
        <li>The base value of a RoE character is what that character was originally obtained for. If purchased as an adopt or custom, the value will be what you paid for it. This can be real world currency, species currency, art, etc.</li>
        <li>RoE character Base Value within the Masterlist will not be updated. However, this does not necessarily reflect the total or current value of the character. Refer to the personal profile linked to the Masterlist profile and the Transfer Logs to see previous transactions and current art for individual character’s worth.</li>
        <li>RoE characters may not be sold for more than they were obtained or purchased for, unless more value has been added. A MYO’s base value is $0, unless purchased with species currency. Then, the value would be in species currency, and the character could only be sold in species currency if no additional value has been added. A MYO has no real world monetary value unless additional value has been added.</li>
        <li>Value is defined as any works of art, written, visual or otherwise, that has been purchased or personally created specifically of the RoE character. Art trades may count towards character value if both sides put in time and effort into pieces for each other. The value of that piece is then determined by the parties in the trade. Gift art (where only one party creates art, and receives nothing in return), does not add monetary value to a RoE character. Personal art done of your own RoE character adds value to those RoE characters.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr class="my-5">

      <h4 class="text-primary mb-3">4.3 Species Currency and Items</h4>
      <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
        <li>Species currency may not be purchased or sold for real world currency, or any form of monetary currency or voucher. This includes, but is not limited to, dA Points, Discord Nitro, other premium game currencies, etc.</li>
        <li>Moonshards relative value is $1 USD, however they may never be purchased or sold for real world currency. This is to maintain a relatively stable economy for RoE.</li>
        <li>You may trade your species currency for RoE items, art, or any non-RoE related things that do not involve a monetary purchase. </li>

      <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
        <li>Any RoE character may be “de-specied”, or removed from any RoE affiliated species at any time. To de-species a RoE character, you must submit a Masterlist help ticket to begin the process.</li>
        <li>The RoE character must have any defining features removed that makes it recognizable as a RoE character. For instance, the Fae Stone (gemstone) on the characters forehead must be removed.</li>
        <li>You must state publicly that the character is not affiliated with the species.</li>
        <li>Any de-specied character must still abide by species ToS, and follow all species rules. This includes, but is not limited to, no NSFW artwork being attached or affiliated with the character, submitting the proper forms if traded or sold, etc.</li>
        <li>A de-specied character may return to the species at any time, provided you obtain all the proper items to re-submit them in the proper channels to reinstate them.</li>

        <li>Voiding is a complete and permanent severance between a character and The Realm of Elune. </li>
        <li>A character may only be voided through a Masterlist Help Ticket. This process requires both a member of the Masterlist team, and an Admin to complete.</li>
        <li>The RoE character must have any defining features removed that makes it recognizable as a RoE character. For instance, the Fae Stone (gemstone) on the characters forehead must be removed.</li>
        <li>A voided RoE character may not, under any circumstance, return to the species. This is a total relinquishing of a characters affiliation and participation between it and The Realm of Elune.</li>
        <li>Any voided RoE characters are no longer affiliated with RoE, and therefore do not need to follow the RoE ToS.</li>
