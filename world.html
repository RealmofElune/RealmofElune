            <p>A large territory encompassing almost all of the eastern side of Elune, 
                The Eirlyn Kingdom has the most widespread development within the realm, 
                with cities and settlements spanning the entire territory. With a temperate 
                climate, temperatures throughout the territory are predictable and constant 
                which allows for a longer growing season than anywhere else in the realm. 
                The lush grasslands and lively forests of the territory grow on very fertile 
                land, providing the perfect place for a wide variety of crops to grow.
            </p>
            <p>The Eirlyn Kingdom also has many exports and industries, the main being 
                agricultural goods and raw materials such as crystals, ore, and minerals. 
                Much of the land is perfect for growing a variety of foods and fibers for 
                crafting, and Crystalspring Forest is home to the largest mines in Elune, 
                Lumlita Caverns. This cave system is the only place within Elune to find such a 
                wide variety of ore and minerals along with massive crystals. Protected fiercely 
                by the Crystal Keepers who inhabit it, the Crystalspring Forest guards its resources 
                from thieves, however are happy to trade with those who ask.

            <h2 class="text-primary mb-3">Overview</h2>    
                <p>As the second largest kingdom in Elune, The Kingdom of Iredale is a diverse 
                    landscape from rolling plains, dense forests, rivers and lakes, to the harsh 
                    frozen mountains of the very west. Home to Hyperboreans who have ruled the 
                    tundras and snow capped cliffs and caverns for decades, very few Kulpera from 
                    other Talents dare to venture into the colder west. However, in the warmer 
                    southeastern part of Iredale, you can find Aqua Searchers at the sparkling 
                    Jade Lake, and Alchemists at home in Leidon Grove and Moonglad Marsh. Most of 
                    the inhabitants in The Kingdom of Iredale are spread throughout the land, with 
                    lots of untamed wilderness in between. Traversing this territory isn't for the 
                    faint of heart, however what you will find in its secluded regions is certainly 
                    worth the trek.

                        govern the small island of Moonhaven in the Southern Sea. This 
                        region is heavily guarded by a royal family to protect the healing 
                        waters and fragile bioluminescent wildlife that thrives in this secluded area. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The Kingdom of Astraeus is by far the most technologically advanced
                         kingdom in the Realm, with highly skilled doctors, astrologists, 
                         scientists, and other members of the High Society rank. Winged Alchemists 
                         are occasionally found there as well, practicing advanced alchemy. The Citadel 
                         itself is a bustling city, filled with Kulpera that are hungry for knowledge, 
                         and want to live an “elevated” lifestyle.

                            still need to get larger laws and ordinances passed through them. Oceanic Officials 
                            are voted on only by those living within their region once every solar cycle.

                            for the duration of their term. Once every five solar cycles an election is held 
                            to vote for a new Chancellor, however there is no maximum a Chancellor may serve. 
                            Any important matters can be brought to Emerald Cove to be discussed with the Chancellor. 
                            Representatives from other territories can meet with the Oceanic Chancellor 
                            here as well, as Emerald Cove is attached to the mainland of The Erilyn Kingdom.

                             are characterized by a harsh and scorched environment. Forged by the relentless 
                             volcanic activity, the harsh landscape is barren aside from the occasional rivers 
                             and pools of lava. However, Volcano Explorers thrive here. The open pools of 
                             lava make for good blacksmithing, and those that reside there take full advantage 
                             of this, crafting some of the finest metalwork in all of Elune. 
                        </p>
                        <p>With barren soil, not much grows on the surface of this island chain, however a 
                            subterranean network of caves inside the larger volcanoes provide a home for its 
                            inhabitants. Fish are abundant in the warm waters surrounding the active volcanoes, 
                            and provide the Volcano Explorers with food, which is supplemented by trade, where 
                            they exchange their prized blacksmithed items for other necessities.

                                        territory serves as a prison for Elune’s criminals, managed and guarded by The Order. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Surrounded by an impenetrable forcefield maintained by the secretive Alchemists of The Order, 
                                        The Badlands are isolated from the rest of the realm. The Order also functions as a high court, 
                                        wielding authority over justice and punishment, and stripping the talent of those who have 
                                        committed the worst of crimes, turning them into Exileds.
